A = A-type AFM order
221 = 2x2x1 supercell
collinear model (LNONCOLLINEAR = FALSE)
No SOC

PAW_PBE: S Cu_pv Fe_pv

Purpose: using the same model (2x2x1, non-collin=true, soc) 
for piezomagnetism and polarization is too heavy. Polarization does not need SOC.

Latest version/patch of VASP 5.4.4 (pl2) was used for these models.
